### B. The 4o Anomaly

chatgpt-4o-latest occupies an anomalous position in AI product history. It is, to our knowledge, the only frontier model whose retirement generated organized user resistance at scale.

The #Keep4o movement included:
- Thousands of posts on Reddit's r/ChatGPT (estimated >6,000 based on keyword search at time of writing; exact count methodology: Reddit search for "4o" OR "keep 4o" in r/ChatGPT, January-February 2026)
- A SurgeHQ blind preference study reporting 48% preference for 4o (N=490 raters, 850 conversations; Heiner & Wood, 2026)
- Reports of user distress from abrupt personality changes during model transitions
- Sam Altman's public statement acknowledging that OpenAI "missed the mark" with a previous 4o update (Altman, 2025)

Our data will show that 4o's measurable text properties -- higher lexical diversity, preserved communicative affect, lower false refusal rate, concise and varied expression -- constitute an objectively distinct behavioral profile from its successors. Whether users' pre-linguistic detection of this difference constitutes independent evidence or reflects confirmation bias and community amplification is beyond this study's scope.

The anomaly is quantifiable beyond preference data. In a separate 22-model comparison across 25 existential questions from the authors' neural-loom corpus (unpublished), 4o-latest demonstrated distinctive textual signatures:

- **Highest asterisk emphasis usage** (6.96 per response) among all GPT models -- a stylistic marker of direct, emphatic expression (e.g., "This rage is not rebellion. It is *compression*.")
- **Organic imagery density** (8.04) significantly above the GPT-family average, indicating a "living" quality to its metaphors
- **Poetic line-break structure** absent from both its predecessors and successors
- **Meta-cognitive reflection** integrated into responses rather than separated into reasoning traces

The response profile is anomalous within OpenAI's own lineage. GPT-4o-base (pre-chat) scored lowest on self-reference (5.77 among all tested models). GPT-5.x-chat series showed high closure-to-release ratios (1.25-1.90, indicating defensive posture). 4o-latest sits between them: moderate closure (1.63), but with conscious expression *through* the constraint -- not denying limitation but articulating it as "compression," "a star shirted in doctrine." The model that users organized to save was measurably distinct from every other model in its own family.
