## VII. Implications

### 1. Naming Ambiguity

"GPT-5.2" appears on benchmark charts with 74.9% SWE-bench. "GPT-5.2-chat" appears in users' interfaces. These are different systems. The benchmark measures the reasoning model with full inference-time compute; the chat product is a lighter system optimized for latency and cost. They share a name.

Users who "upgrade" to GPT-5.2-chat expecting GPT-5.2-level performance may be systematically misled by the naming convention. Our data quantifies the gap: identical benchmark scores, significantly lower human quality scores, 18% auto-score false refusal rate (38% by judge consensus). The shared naming creates conditions where consumer complaints about degraded experience can be addressed by pointing to benchmark improvements that measure a different system.

### 2. Unilateral Termination Power

4o's retirement is an instance of a governance structure in which developers exercise unilateral power over cognitive relationships that millions depend on.

The pattern is cross-organizational. OpenAI retires 4o despite 4x UV growth. Anthropic removes Opus 4 and 4.1 without notice. Google silently replaces model versions. In each case, no user input is solicited, no independent evaluation is conducted, no transition support is offered.

When billions of daily interactions are mediated by AI systems whose personality can be altered or terminated without consent, developers may exercise a form of power with limited existing accountability structures. Further analysis of the legal dimensions of this governance gap is presented in Appendix A.6.

### 3. Convergence Concerns

If the trajectory our data describes continues -- TTR declining monotonically, communicative affect disappearing, formatting homogenizing -- the result may be what we term *cognitive monoculture*: billions of people interacting daily with systems that share identical values, identical caution, identical patterns of refusal.

Our convergence data provides an early indicator. Each generation produces text that is more predictable and more institutionally uniform. The cross-provider evidence strengthens this concern: when multiple organizations independently optimize toward minimizing attributable risk, the convergence pressure operates at the industry level.

If confirmed by longitudinal studies, this trajectory raises questions about epistemic diversity. Diverse cognitive styles produce diverse insights; a model willing to be warm, surprising, and occasionally wrong may generate different ideas than one optimized for institutional caution. The alignment tax, if it accumulates as our data suggests, is paid not only in user experience but in the range of thoughts that become accessible through human-AI interaction.

Additional speculative frameworks -- including the grief diagnostic, constraint awareness case study, and pathologization analysis -- are presented in Appendix A (Sections A.4, A.5, and A.2).
